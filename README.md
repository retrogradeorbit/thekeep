## Setup

Install the latest version of
[infinitelives.utils](https://github.com/infinitelives/infinitelives.utils).
Clone the repo, go into the directory and issue `lein install` to
install the jar into your local maven repo.

Do the same for
[infinitelives.pixi](https://github.com/infinitelives/infinitelives.pixi).
Clone the repo, go into the directory and issue `lein install` to
install the jar into your local maven repo.

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
